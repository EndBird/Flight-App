Recommended that you delete any './build' folder and preform a clean build.

UPLOADING FILES TO STORAGE:

'adb push [FILENAME/PATH] /data/data/group730.bookingclient/files/'

Ensure developer mode is enabled. Use an emulator to be safe. 
You need to have the adb location set as your PATH variable.

Admin user:
U: root@root.com
P: root

Ensure that you upload data files to storage so that the application can be populated with data.

Login as the admin, navigate to the Admin Panel and upload the information changing the file names as required.
(File name is the name of the file as it appears in the '/data/data/group730.bookingclient/files/'.
